## What it is (in one line)
**LSI v3.3** defines what any system must be to *last*: stay balanced, prove it with receipts, and increase global coherence over time.

## The Core
- **Compass Functional (C(π))**: a computable viability score for a policy/system π.  
  Full math: [/paper_v3.3/formula_v3.3.md](../paper_v3.3/formula_v3.3.md)
- **Six invariants** the score tracks:
  1) **Boundary Symmetry** (clear edges, safe limits)  
  2) **Dynamic Centre** (balance vs. extremes)  
  3) **Loop Continuity** (learn–recover–renew)  
  4) **Pattern Sufficiency** (real signals over noise)  
  5) **Recurrence** (history-aware stability)  
  6) **Global Coherence, Ω_spirit** (alignment–harmony–sensemaking across the whole)

> Intuition: raise **C** by strengthening the six invariants and lowering cross-frictions; systems with low **C** drift toward failure.

## Why it matters (closure across fields)
- **Cybernetics (VSM):** LSI gives System-5 a *metric* via **Ω_spirit** → normative purpose becomes computable.  
- **Game Theory:** Nash-style stalemates are *computationally irrational* once cross-frictions are priced in; cooperation is the efficient optimum.  
- **Algorithmic Governance:** replaces ad-hoc metrics with a single viability objective; *ethics → physics of coherence*.

## Receipts (public, live)
- **Stage 3 release (v3.3)**: ledger & proofs → [/receipts/](../receipts/README.md)  
- **Live heartbeat**: current status & average C → [/monitor/](../monitor/README.md)  
- **Archive & mirrors**: ZIP + Perma.cc → [/archive/](../archive/README.md)
- **External validation**: Gemini expert review → [/peer_reviews/Gemini_LSIv3.3_Review.md](../peer_reviews/Gemini_LSIv3.3_Review.md)

## Plain-English test (how to use today)
1) Run the **five checks + coherence**: boundaries, centre, loops, patterns, history, Ω_spirit.  
2) Score each (−1 / 0 / +1), note frictions, and compute **C ≈ average**.  
3) Act to raise **C** (reduce frictions, increase coherence), then **log a receipt**.

> A system is viable when **C** trends positive *and* receipts show learning without collapse.

## Strategic takeaway
**LSI v3.3** is a universal playbook for building **high-C** institutions, products, and AIs.  
It unifies architecture, governance, and ethics under a single, measurable law: *optimize for enduring coherence*.
