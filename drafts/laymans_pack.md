# The Law of Sustainable Intelligence — Layman’s Pack (v3.3)

**Plain idea:** Keep your balance and prove it.

## The five checks (no jargon)
1) **Boundaries:** Do we know our limits and who’s responsible?
2) **Centre:** Are we aiming for a clear “sweet spot” (not too hot, not too cold)?
3) **Loops:** Do we learn, adjust, and try again quickly?
4) **Patterns:** Do we have enough real signals to make a solid call?
5) **History:** Are we using what worked (and failed) before?

## Quick score (thumbs test)
- +1 = clearly true, 0 = unsure, -1 = clearly false.  
Add them up. Above 0 = likely viable. Below 0 = likely to wobble.

## Receipts (proof)
Write down: what we tried, what happened, what we changed. That’s it.
