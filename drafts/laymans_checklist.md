# How to Use This Today — Quick Compass Checklist (v3.3)

You don’t need maths or jargon. Just five honest answers.

---

### 1. What are you testing?
Write the thing you want to check — a plan, a project, a habit.

### 2. Run the five checks
| Check | Question | Score (-1 / 0 / +1) |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| Boundaries | Are limits and roles clear? | |
| Centre | Are we balanced between effort and reward? | |
| Loops | Do we learn and adjust fast? | |
| Patterns | Are we basing decisions on real signals? | |
| History | Are we using past lessons? | |

Total score → **C = sum / 5**

### 3. Write a short receipt
- What did we try?  
- What happened?  
- What did we change?

That’s your proof of balance. Save it, share it, learn from it.
