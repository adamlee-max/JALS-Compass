Subject: Submission of manuscript — "The Law of Sustainable Intelligence (v5.1_final)"

Dear Editor,

Please find enclosed my manuscript entitled "The Law of Sustainable Intelligence", submitted for consideration in the *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*. The paper presents a formal framework—supported by empirical validation—linking systemic coherence to long-term viability across biological, organisational, and artificial systems.

The work introduces the **Viability Functional** \(\mathcal{C}(\pi)\), a mathematically defined measure of balance derived from five invariants of sustainable intelligence. Using the *JALS Compass* implementation, I provide reproducible evidence that systems maintaining cooperative symmetry remain stable, while anti-coherent controls collapse below a falsifiable threshold \(C < 0.2\). These findings establish a rigorous, cross-disciplinary law of sustainable organisation that unites information theory, game theory, and systems science.

The manuscript and all supporting data are publicly archived and fully reproducible through the open-source JALS-Compass repository (GitHub: https://github.com/adamlee-max/JALS-Compass). All ethical and authorship standards have been met, and no AI agents are listed as co-authors.

I believe this work will be of particular interest to readers focused on complex systems, information dynamics, and the mathematical foundations of intelligence.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
