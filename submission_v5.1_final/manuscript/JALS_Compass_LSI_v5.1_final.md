# Abstract
<!-- Paste the contents of submission_v5.1_final/abstract.md here. -->

# 1. Introduction
We propose the JALS Compass × Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI), a universal viability functional \( \mathcal{C}(\pi,t) \) that assesses whether a system can hold its dynamic centre under perturbation. We motivate the five invariants, define the operational signals, and outline falsifiable predictions.

# 2. Framework
## 2.1 Invariants and Signals
Summarise each invariant and its measurement signal.
<!-- If needed, weave in key mapping points from INVARIANT_MAPPING_v5.1.md. -->

## 2.2 Viability Functional
We define \( \mathcal{C}(\pi,t) \) with normalised terms and the \(\Omega_{\text{spirit}}\) coupling capturing cross-invariant coherence. Provide the exact functional form used in v5.1_final and parameter notes.

## 2.3 Drift & Recovery
Define drift diagnostics and recovery envelopes (incl. interpretation of \( \Delta \mathcal{C} \)).

# 3. Methods
## 3.1 Data and Preprocessing
Brief description of datasets and preprocessing steps.

## 3.2 Computation of \( \mathcal{C} \)
Algorithmic steps to compute the viability score.

## 3.3 Null (Anti-JALS) Model
Define the collapse scenario and thresholds.

# 4. Results
## 4.1 Core Result
Report observed \( \mathcal{C} \) ranges and stability under perturbations.

## 4.2 Anti-JALS Collapse Check
State the empirical finding that collapse occurs with \( \mathcal{C} < 0.2 \) in the null model and reference the figure.

## 4.3 Receipts (Operational Proof)
Summarise receipts demonstrating reproducibility and auditability.

# 5. Discussion
Interpretation, limitations, robustness, and implications for AI safety/governance and complex systems.

# 6. Conclusion
The LSI provides a measurable path to sustainable intelligence and balanced co-evolution.
