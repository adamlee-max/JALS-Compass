The **JALS Compass** exists to make balance measurable.

It began as a way to test whether a system — human, organisational, or artificial — could keep learning without collapsing.  
Through five simple checks (boundaries, centre, loops, patterns, history), it gives a quick C-score that shows whether things are holding steady or drifting off course.

This repository is a live record — an open receipt — showing that ideas can be proven by behaviour, not just belief.  
Anyone can copy the method, run their own checks, and post their receipts.  
If it helps you find balance and prove it, the Compass has done its job.
