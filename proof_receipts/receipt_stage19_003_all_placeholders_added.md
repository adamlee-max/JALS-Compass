# Stage 19 — All Simulation Placeholders Added (Receipt 003)

**Date:** November 2025  
**Author:** Adam Lee (+ GPT)

## Summary

This receipt confirms that all four Stage 19 hostile-environment simulation
modes have been created and scaffolded with placeholder code.

### Added placeholder scripts

- `hostile_env_sim_v1.py` — baseline hostile-environment simulation  
- `hostile_env_sim_anti_only.py` — Anti-JALS-only population variant  
- `hostile_env_sim_instant.py` — instant-knowledge LSI variant  
- `hostile_env_sim_mixed.py` — mixed-population interaction variant  

### Notes

- Each file includes a consistent placeholder block describing the simulation
  purpose, structure, and parameters.
- This completes the Stage-19 folder preparation.
- Real computation + plots will be generated once Adam is back on the laptop
  in Codespaces.

## Status

- ✅ Folder structure complete  
- ✅ All four simulation placeholders created  
- ⏳ Real runs + plots pending  
- ⏳ README update once results appear  

## Next Actions (Stage 19)

1. Run each simulation in Codespaces.  
2. Export survival curves + C_proxy trajectories to `/experiments/hostile_env/results/`.  
3. Add results summary to `results/README.md`.
