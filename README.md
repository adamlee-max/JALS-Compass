> **The JALS Compass** is a practical framework for checking if any system — human, organisational, or AI — is *balanced enough to last*.
>
> It works through five simple checks (boundaries, centre, loops, patterns, history) and produces a quick C-score to show stability.
>
> Think of it as a reality gauge: “Are we still balanced, and can we prove it?”# JALS Compass × Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI) — Stage 3 (v3.3)

**Status:** Stage 3 – LSI v3.3 locked • **Date:** 30 Oct 2025 (UTC+0)  
**Purpose:** This repo is the canonical, timestamped record (“receipt of existence”) for the JALS Compass and the Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI).

## What this is
The **JALS Compass** operationalises the **Law of Sustainable Intelligence** using five invariants:
1) Boundary Symmetry  2) Dynamic Centre  3) Loop Continuity  4) Pattern Sufficiency  5) Recurrence

v3.3 introduces: time-varying weights **wᵢ(t, π)**, cross-invariant coupling **κᵢⱼ**, and a formalised global coherence term **Ω_spirit**.  
The full functional and definitions live in `/paper_v3.3/formula_v3.3.md`.

## Why this repo matters
- **Single source of truth** for the math, proofs, and receipts.  
- **Public traceability:** each commit is a dated receipt.  
- **Interoperable:** papers, app blueprints, and validations reference this repo.

## Repo layout (Stage 3 seed)
- `/paper_v3.3/` — academic paper materials (outline, formula, abstract)
- `/receipts/` — validation runs & logs (Compass Receipts)
- `/drafts/` — philosophical companion & notes
- `/assets/` — diagrams and figures
- `README.md` — (this file) project home

## Quick start
- Read the functional: `/paper_v3.3/formula_v3.3.md`  
- See proof templates: `/receipts/compass_receipt_001.md` (coming next step)  
- Track changes via Releases (v3.3+)
