## 🔹 What is the Compass?  
The Guardian–JALS Compass is a framework for testing whether any system — biological, financial, ecological, technological, or social — is **viable**.  

It works by scoring a system across five invariants:  

1. **Boundary Symmetry** – Every system sits between two collapse edges.  
2. **Dynamic Centre** – The further from balance, the higher the risk.  
3. **Loop–Continuity** – Collapse and renewal are defaults, not bugs.  
4. **Pattern Sufficiency** – Fragments can reveal the whole.  
5. **History/Recurrence** – Past failures shape future survival.  

The Compass calculates a **viability score (C)** between -1.0 and +1.0:  

\[
C(\pi) = 0.3E[m] + 0.3R - 0.2Pr - 0.1H - 0.1G
\]

Where:  
- **E[m]** = ability to maintain structure  
- **R** = recovery/repair capacity  
- **Pr** = risk of breaching boundaries  
- **H** = opacity of patterns (how unclear things are)  
- **G** = historical regret (unlearned lessons)

## 🔹 Why it matters  
- **Universal lens:** Works across domains.  
- **Receipts-first:** Every score shows its working.  
- **Practical:** Can guide real-world decisions, from projects to AI safety to climate systems.

## 🔹 Example  
**System:** Trading strategy with 3:1 leverage, no stoploss, single exchange.  

- E[m] = 0.4 (fragile)  
- R = 0.2 (no recovery loop)  
- Pr = 0.8 (high collapse risk)  
- H = 0.5 (unclear metrics)  
- G = 0.6 (unlearned lessons)  

**Compass Score:** C = -0.08 → **Failing**.  

Receipts: Risk of collapse is high; needs recovery loops and boundaries.
