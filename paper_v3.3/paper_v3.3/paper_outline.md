# Paper Outline — JALS Compass × Law of Sustainable Intelligence (v3.3)

**Purpose:** Framework for the academic submission.  
Each section expands from here into LaTeX/Markdown when drafting begins.

---

## I. Introduction
Define sustainability in intelligence; outline the need for a universal viability law.

## II. Theoretical Foundation
Derive the five invariants and the functional \( \mathcal{C}(\pi) \).

## III. Mathematical Model
Formal definition of dynamic weights \( w_i(t,\pi) \), coupling \( \kappa_{ij} \), and coherence term \( \Omega_{\text{spirit}} \).

## IV. Simulation & Validation
Cross-domain Compass receipts (finance, AI, education, climate).

## V. Discussion
Interpretation — emergence, alignment, and sustainable intelligence as meta-law.

## VI. Appendices
Uncertainty metrics, adversarial robustness, drift monitoring.

## VII. References & Receipts
Peer-AI evaluations, GitHub commits, and proof logs.
