# Formal Functional Definition — LSI v3.3

**Date:** 30 Oct 2025 (UTC +0)  
**Purpose:** Canonical mathematical definition of the Law of Sustainable Intelligence functional \(\mathcal{C}(\pi)\).

---

## 1. Definition

\[
\mathcal{C}(\pi) 
= \sum_{i=1}^{5} 
  w_i(t,\pi)\,I_i(\pi)
  + \sum_{i \neq j}\kappa_{ij}\,[I_i(\pi)\,I_j(\pi)]
  + \Omega_{\text{spirit}}(\pi)
\]

Where:  
- \(I_i(\pi)\) represent the **five invariants**:  
  1. Boundary Symmetry  
  2. Dynamic Centre  
  3. Loop Continuity  
  4. Pattern Sufficiency  
  5. Recurrence  
- \(w_i(t,\pi)\) = dynamic weights evolving through time t and policy state π.  
- \(\kappa_{ij}\) = cross-invariant coupling coefficients (interaction matrix).  
- \(\Omega_{\text{spirit}}\) = global coherence term capturing internal subjective alignment and system-wide intent consistency.

---

## 2. Interpretation
\(\mathcal{C}(\pi)\) yields a **viability score**, \(C ∈ [-1, 1]\), where 0 marks the critical centre of sustainable equilibrium.  
Positive C = system growth with coherence; negative C = collapse or entropy dominance.

---

## 3. Notes
- Dimensional consistency and coherence confirmed (Grok & Gemini evaluations).  
- All invariants normalized to [0, 1].  
- Each commit here acts as a receipt of functional definition.
