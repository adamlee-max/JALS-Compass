# Stage 11 — Dual Validation Summary (004)

**Version:** v5.1_final  
**Gemini Report:** Stage 11 Re-Audit Report — Gemini (NEEDS EDIT)  
**Grok Report:** Stage 11 Re-Audit Report — Grok (PASS)  

### Findings
- **Invariant Coherence:** Both auditors confirm theoretical stability of B, D, L, P, R.  
- **Mapping and Empirics:** Gemini flagged missing proxy mappings and falsification plots; Grok verified them present in the updated packet.  
- **Authorship and Versioning:** Gemini noted v3.3/v5.1 mismatch and AI co-authorship issue; Grok confirmed v5.1_final header and authorship integrity fixed.  
- **Overall:** Framework logically sound and falsifiable; external submission materials still require curation for journal-grade reproducibility.

**Verdict:** Stage 11 Re-Audit Completed — Framework Confirmed Valid; Documentation Requires Editorial Re-Alignment.
