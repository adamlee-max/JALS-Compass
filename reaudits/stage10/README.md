# Stage 10 — Edit Cycle & Proof Insertion

**Objective:** Address the outstanding empirical and structural gaps identified in Stage 9 re-audit (Gemini × Grok).

---

### Outstanding Fixes
1. Create `invariant_mapping_extended.md` — explicit dimensional mapping (Iᵢ ↔ Eₘ, R, Pr, H, G).  
2. Generate and log Anti-JALS falsification data + plot in `/results/anti_jals_collapse.*`.  
3. Unify all metadata, headers, and filenames to **v5.1_final**.

---

### Process
Each correction will be handled as a mini-receipt with checksum confirmation:
- `receipt_014_dimensional_fix.md`  
- `receipt_015_falsification_data.md`  
- `receipt_016_metadata_alignment.md`  

After all three are complete → push to `Stage10_VERIFICATION_MANIFEST.md` for dual-AI closure review.
