### Meta-Loop Example — Live Audit Launch (Oct 2025)

_This marks the beginning of the JALS Compass live experiment._

Each use of the Compass produces a **receipt** (inputs → score → outcome).  
Those receipts are the self-auditing mechanism that test the Compass in real time.

**Invariant focus:**  
- Boundary Symmetry — live use between theory and practice  
- Dynamic Centre — adjusts as real data arrive  
- Loop-Continuity — self-correction built-in  
- Pattern Sufficiency — fragments (individual uses) prove the whole  
- History/Recurrence — results feed back into next versions  

**Goal:**  
To demonstrate that the Compass self-validates through transparent, voluntary, real-world use.
