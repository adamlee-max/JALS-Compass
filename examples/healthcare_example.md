## Healthcare System — Resource Allocation Stress Test  
_Applied JALS Compass Invariants to evaluate balance between efficiency, equity, and resilience._

**Summary verdict:** ⚖️ *Stable but strained* (C = 0.27)  
> The system maintains viability under moderate stress but risks collapse if equity (centre) is neglected.

---

### Scenario  
A national healthcare service facing increased demand from aging populations and budget constraints. Leaders debate between cutting costs, raising taxes, or adopting new AI-driven efficiency measures.

### Compass Invariant Breakdown  
| Invariant | Observation | Impact |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Boundary Symmetry** | Spending caps limit flexibility; workforce burnout nears critical edge. | Moderate risk |
| **Centre Law** | Equity and efficiency are in tension — current bias toward efficiency moves system off-centre. | Negative |
| **Loop–Continuity** | Feedback from local services often ignored at national level. | Weak loop |
| **Pattern Sufficiency** | Data on patient outcomes underused in planning. | Recoverable |
| **Non-Origin (Recurrence)** | Past reforms show cycles of crisis → reform → strain. System not learning fast enough. | High improvement potential |

---

### Final Assessment  
The healthcare system’s viability depends on maintaining *balance* between financial efficiency and social equity.  
Introducing adaptive feedback loops (e.g., regional autonomy and transparent outcome reporting) would raise **C(π)** to ≈ 0.45.  
Without this correction, collapse risk increases exponentially under demographic pressure.
