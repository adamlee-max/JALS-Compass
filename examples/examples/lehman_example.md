# Compass Example — Lehman Brothers Collapse (2008)

**Summary verdict: Failing (C = 0.00)** → No viable boundaries, no recovery loop, opaque metrics, repeated unlearned lessons.

---

## Scenario
Lehman Brothers operated with extreme leverage (~30:1), opaque mortgage-backed securities, no effective recovery mechanisms, and failed to adapt lessons from earlier financial crises.

---

## Invariant breakdown (receipts)

- **E[m] = 0.3** — fragile structure, over-leveraged  
- **R = 0.0** — no recovery/repair loop once liquidity dried  
- **Pr = 1.0** — boundary breached (housing collapse, counterparty risk)  
- **H = 0.7** — opaque metrics, hidden risk in derivatives  
- **G = 0.9** — repeated systemic mistakes (ignored LTCM, dot-com bubble lessons)  

---

## C(π) calculation

C = 0.3E[m] + 0.3R - 0.2Pr - 0.1H - 0.1G  

= (0.3×0.3) + (0.3×0.0) - (0.2×1.0) - (0.1×0.7) - (0.1×0.9)  
= 0.09 + 0 - 0.20 - 0.07 - 0.09  
= **-0.27 → Failing**

---

Receipts: Collapse inevitable without recovery mechanisms, boundaries, or transparency.
