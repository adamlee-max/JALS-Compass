# Compass Example — Lehman Brothers (2008 Collapse)

**Summary verdict: Critical collapse (C = 0.00)**  
Lehman Brothers showed systemic fragility across all five invariants. No viable recovery loops or boundary buffers were in place.

---

## Scenario
Global investment bank with heavy exposure to subprime mortgages, high leverage, and dependence on short-term funding.  
Failure to secure a bailout or merger triggered bankruptcy on September 15, 2008.

## Invariant breakdown (receipts)

- **E[m] = 0.3** — Fragile core process: overexposure to toxic assets.  
- **R = 0.0** — No recovery loop: government bailout rejected, liquidity freeze.  
- **Pr = 1.0** — Maximum boundary pressure: leverage >30:1, balance sheet near collapse edge.  
- **H = 0.7** — Transparency failures: hidden off-balance-sheet exposures.  
- **G = 1.0** — Recurrence ignored: systemic warnings (Bear Stearns) unheeded.

## C(π) calculation

\[
C = 0.3E[m] + 0.3R - 0.2Pr - 0.1H - 0.1G
\]

= (0.3×0.3) + (0.3×0.0) − (0.2×1.0) − (0.1×0.7) − (0.1×1.0)  
= 0.09 + 0.00 − 0.20 − 0.07 − 0.10  
= **−0.28 → Critical collapse**
