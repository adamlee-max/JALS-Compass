# JALS Compass — Cross-Domain Analysis of Recent Scientific Studies
_Status: Draft for Stage 1 evidence base • Owner: Adam Lee • Last updated: 2025-10-13_

## One-Breath Trigger
Find the edges. Hold the centre. Log the loop. Share the power. Prove it with receipts.

## Purpose
Demonstrate that a single invariant set (Boundaries, Dynamic Centre, Loop-Continuity, Pattern Sufficiency, Recurrence) + a viability functional C(π) can audit complex systems across domains.

## Reading Guide
Each study → (1) Summary, (2) Five-Invariant Audit, (3) C(π) viability notes, (4) Receipt.
Receipts = concrete upgrades: missing loops, boundary symmetry fixes, early-warning signals, metrics.

## 1) Climate Science — Tipping Elements & Cascades (Wunderling et al., 2024)
**Summary.** Review maps major tipping elements (ice sheets, AMOC, permafrost, rainforests, monsoons) and their interactions; many are destabilising, raising cascade risk around ~1.5–2 °C.

**Five-Invariant Audit**
- **Boundary Symmetry.** Prior siloed models broke symmetry; subsystems are porous and mutually coupled. Expand model boundary to atmosphere–ocean–biosphere linkages.
- **Dynamic Centre.** Post-tipping dynamics re-centre internally (self-propelling melt/dieback). Policy models must switch from linear control to runaway-aware regimes.
- **Loop-Continuity.** Positive feedbacks (e.g., permafrost–methane) must be explicitly closed in models; missing loops = false stability.
- **Pattern Sufficiency.** Combine modern obs, paleo abrupt shifts, multi-model ensembles; stress-test simultaneous multi-tipping scenarios.
- **Recurrence.** Paleoclimate domino events are historical echoes; build early-warning indicators so slow processes recur in our awareness.

**C(π) — Viability Notes.** Viability declines non-linearly beyond ~1.5 °C; policy π must move trajectories inside safe bounds; four-prong strategy (obs, models, compute, expert elicitation) feeds the control loop.

**Receipt.** Add a “cascade suite” of scenarios (e.g., GIS + AMOC + Amazon) to Earth-system runs; publish an open early-warning dashboard with threshold proximity metrics.

## 2) AI Safety — Managing Extreme AI Risks (Bengio et al., 2024)
**Summary.** Calls for commensurate technical & governance action to manage frontier-AI risks up to loss-of-control scenarios.

**Five-Invariant Audit**
- **Boundary Symmetry.** Close the weakest-link problem: incentives/obligations must cover *all* high-capability actors (labs, states, OSS, defence).
- **Dynamic Centre.** Anticipate centre shift into AI-automated R&D; embed circuit-breakers and human re-centring mechanisms.
- **Loop-Continuity.** Stand up global incident reporting, red-team→regulator feedback, real-time auditing; tighten on evidence, not vibes.
- **Pattern Sufficiency.** Expand beyond known failure modes: simulate out-of-distribution, rare events, adversarial multi-agent play.
- **Recurrence.** Learn from nuclear/aviation/software near-miss cultures; institutionalise memory so safety doesn’t decay.

**C(π) — Viability Notes.** Tilt capability:safety ratio; define “no-go” autonomy/replication levels without proofs-of-safety; set measurable safety margins.

**Receipt.** Create a **Frontier AI Circuit-Breaker Standard**: pre-registered kill-paths, rate-limiters, and rollback proofs for any system that designs the next system.

## 3) Economics — Transforming Economics for a Polycrisis (Kenter et al., 2025)
**Summary.** Synthesises 10 principles to re-centre economics on planetary & social wellbeing (limits, justice, participation, complexity).

**Five-Invariant Audit**
- **Boundary Symmetry.** Internalise environmental & social externalities; align the economy as a subsystem of Earth & society.
- **Dynamic Centre.** Shift from GDP to wellbeing; create adaptive institutions (“Wellbeing Fed”) that can re-weight goals in crises.
- **Loop-Continuity.** Hard-wire policy feedbacks to planetary boundary signals (auto-tighten carbon budgets, trigger investments).
- **Pattern Sufficiency.** Add empirics & stress tests: compound-shock scenarios (climate + finance), trade-off maps (justice vs. degrowth).
- **Recurrence.** Don’t repeat “reform then forget”: build observatories and curricula to preserve institutional memory.

**C(π) — Viability Notes.** Define a Global Viability Index (climate, biodiversity, inequality, health resiliency) and test policy π against it.

**Receipt.** Publish an annual **Viability Stress Test** for national budgets akin to bank stress tests.

## 4) Medicine/Public Health — Learning Loops & Resilience (Neill & Peters, 2023; Saulnier et al., 2023)
**Summary.** Health systems that institutionalised single/double/triple-loop learning adapted better during COVID-19.

**Five-Invariant Audit**
- **Boundary Symmetry.** Link health ↔ community ↔ economy; include marginalised voices in the learning loop.
- **Dynamic Centre.** Pivot command to emergency mode fast; maintain a permanent resilience unit for peacetime scanning/crisis action.
- **Loop-Continuity.** Real-time data→action; after-action reviews and learning health system infrastructure.
- **Pattern Sufficiency.** Drill diverse hazards (pandemic + heatwave + cyber) and share cross-regional playbooks.
- **Recurrence.** Institutionalise memory so lessons survive turnover; expect multi-hazard years.

**C(π) — Viability Notes.** Build a Resilience Scorecard (adaptation lead-time, surge buffers, supply diversity, staff cross-training).

**Receipt.** National **Health Resilience Ledger**: open indicators, quarterly drills, public after-action reports.

## Viability Functional (Sketch)
\[
\mathcal{C}(\pi)= w_1\,\mathbb{E}[m(x_t)] + w_2\,\mathcal{R}(\pi) - w_3\,\Pr(x_t\notin K)
\]
- **xₜ:** system state; **K:** viable set; **m:** mission metric; **R(π):** resilience under shocks.
- **Implementation hint.** For each domain, define K (boundaries), select m, pick shocks, estimate R(π), and report C with receipts.
