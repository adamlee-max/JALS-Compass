## Education Reform â€” Systemic Equity Test  
_Applied JALS Compass Invariants to assess fairness, resilience, and long-term viability in education policy design._

**Summary verdict:** Stable (C = 0.42) â†’  
Moderate imbalance between accessibility and funding pressure, but recoverable with loop reinforcement through teacher training and adaptive technology.

---

### Scenario  
A national education policy proposes funding cuts to secondary schools to increase investment in higher education and digital transformation programs.

---

### Invariant Breakdown  
| Invariant | Observation | Effect on System |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Boundary Symmetry** | Underfunded secondary layer causes edge pressure; higher education benefits create an internal imbalance. | Risk of collapse in early development pipeline. |
| **Centre Law** | Central focus shifts toward prestige institutions, away from equality of opportunity. | Weakens societal centre, raising long-term inequality. |
| **Loopâ€“Continuity** | Short political cycles create renewal gaps between reforms. | Resilience limited by inconsistent feedback loops. |
| **Pattern Sufficiency** | Pilot programs show small successes; fragments indicate scalable potential. | Partial evidence of recovery pattern. |
| **Non-Origin (Recurrence)** | Historic reforms show repeating imbalance between access and excellence. | Recurrence indicates design flaw, but also predictable fix. |

### Summary  
Without adaptive rebalancing, this policy risks deepening educational inequality and lowering national productivity. However, with targeted loop reinforcement (teacher support + digital tools), the system stabilises around a viable dynamic centre.
