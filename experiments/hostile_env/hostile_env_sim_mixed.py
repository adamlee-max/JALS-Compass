Stage 19 – Hostile Environment Simulation (PLACEHOLDER)

This file is a placeholder for the full hostile-environment simulation logic.

Final version (to be completed in Codespaces) will include:
    • Agent class (JALS vs Anti-JALS)
    • Hostility parameters (attack probability, visibility asymmetry, noise)
    • C_proxy updates per step
    • Survival tracking + collapse conditions
    • Optional: dynamic weights, learning modes, instant-knowledge modes
    • Plot generation (survival curves, C_proxy trajectories)

This placeholder exists so the folder is complete and auditable.
The working logic will be added on laptop when coding is practical.
