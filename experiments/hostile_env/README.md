🧪 Hostile-Environment Experiments (Stage 19)

This folder contains the simulations where environmental hostility is varied and stress-tested — e.g.,
high attack probability, visibility asymmetry, noise, drift amplification,
and other “anti-JALS” conditions.

These experiments implement:
	•	✔️ Grok’s hostile-environment suggestion
	•	✔️ Dynamic-weight proxy adjustments
	•	✔️ Learning-enabled agent behaviour
	•	✔️ Instant-knowledge LSI tests
	•	✔️ Mixed population interaction tests

New results will be added here as each hostile-environment experiment is completed.
