# 🧪 Hostile-Environment Experiments (Stage 19)

Stage 19 contains the stress-test simulations where environmental hostility is varied and increased — e.g. high attack probability, visibility asymmetry, noise, drift amplification, and other “anti-JALS” conditions.

The goal is to test whether coherence (C_proxy) still predicts survival under extreme conditions.These simulations include four modes:

- **Anti-JALS only** (`hostile_env_sim_anti_only.py`)
- **Mixed population** (`hostile_env_sim_mixed.py`)
- **Instant-knowledge agents** (`hostile_env_sim_instant.py`)
- **Baseline hostile environment** (`hostile_env_sim_v1.py`)
