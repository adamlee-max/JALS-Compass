## 1. Purpose

Record the first formal submission of the Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI v5.1) to a Royal Society journal, including the exact package used and its repository provenance.

This receipt anchors the chain of custody for later re-submission to Royal Society Open Science (RSOS).

## 2. Files Submitted

From `stage7/SUBMISSION_PACKAGE/manuscript/`:

- `Manuscript_v5.1.pdf`  
- `Cover_Letter_v5.1.pdf`

Supplementary / package (as allowed by portal):

- `JALS-Compass_SubmissionPackage_v5.1_final.zip`  
- `JALS-Compass_SubmissionPackage_v5.1_final.sha256`

(If the portal did *not* accept the ZIP, this line documents the intended package and checksum.)

## 3. Repository Provenance

**Repo:** `adamlee-max/JALS-Compass`

- `manuscript/Manuscript_v5.1.pdf`
- `manuscript/Cover_Letter_v5.1.pdf`
- `metadata/INVARIANT_MAPPING_v5.1.md`
- `metadata/VERSION_MAP_v3.3_to_v5.1.md`

## 4. Scope and Version Notes

- **Theory version:** LSI v5.1 (functional C(π) with Ω_spirit and six conceptual invariants).  
- **Repo track:** `v5.1_clean` as documented in `VERSION_MAP_v3.3_to_v5.1.md`.  
- **Invariant mapping:** operational proxies defined for five primary invariants (E_m, R, Pr, H, G); Emergent Coherence tracked as a higher-order coherence term (to be clarified in RSOS v5.2).

This means the submission was scientifically self-consistent at the time, but later work (v5.2) will make the six-invariant structure explicit and fully harmonised between repo and manuscript.

## 5. Submission Outcome (at time of logging)

At the time of this receipt:

- Status: **Submitted — decision pending**.  
- No reviewer reports or editorial decisions had yet been issued.  
- No scientific criticism or requested changes existed.

A follow-up receipt (`RSOS-001_Interface_DeskReject`) will log the editorial decision once received.

---

## 6. Why this receipt exists

This receipt ensures:

- Transparent documentation of when and how LSI v5.1 entered formal peer review channels.  
- A clean link between Git commit, submission package, and journal metadata.  
- A stable anchor for later RSOS submissions, so future reviewers can trace the history of the work.

It closes the gap between the internal Stage 7 submission package and the external Royal Society submission event.
