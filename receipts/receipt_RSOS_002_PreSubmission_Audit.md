# Receipt RSOS-002 — Pre-Submission Audit for RSOS (LSI v5.2)

**Date:** 17 Nov 2025 (UTC+0)  
**Author:** Adam Lee  
**Project:** Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI)  
**Target Journal:** Royal Society Open Science (RSOS)  
**Purpose:** Confirm readiness of the LSI v5.2 manuscript and repository for submission.

## 1. Objective of this Audit

This receipt documents the audit performed prior to preparing the RSOS submission of the Law of Sustainable Intelligence.  
It ensures:

- manuscript consistency  
- invariant mapping coherence  
- reproducibility integrity  
- correct version references  
- complete receipt chain  
- compliance with RSOS scope and editorial expectations  

This establishes a transparent record for open-science provenance.

## 2. Manuscript Status (v5.1 → v5.2 Upgrade)

The manuscript submitted to Interface (v5.1) is scientifically intact.  
Updates planned for v5.2 (RSOS-ready):

1. Tone adjustment in abstract + introduction (RSOS-friendly)  
2. Clarification of Ω_spirit definition and mathematical role  
3. Harmonisation of invariant terminology across:
   - manuscript  
   - GitHub repo  
   - mapping files  
4. Minor editorial hydration for clarity  
5. Addition of RSOS-focused reproducibility paragraph  
6. Optional: simplified figure (C(t) recovery plot)  

These updates **do not** change the fundamental theory.

## 3. Repository Audit Summary (as of this receipt)

Performed checks:

- ✔️ `receipts/` folder: complete and coherent  
- ✔️ Interface submission logged (`RSOS-000`)  
- ✔️ Interface decision logged (`RSOS-001`)  
- ✔️ File structure stable across branches  
- ✔️ Simulation assets present (`results/`)  
- ✔️ Anti-JALS falsification data present  
- ✔️ Version mapping files available  
- ✔️ Zenodo DOI already assigned  
- ✔️ Licence + README structure intact  

Pending for v5.2 RSOS submission:

- 🔲 README simplification for RSOS  
- 🔲 Quickstart reproducibility block  
- 🔲 Snapshot export of final submission folder  

Everything required for RSOS submission is present.

## 4. RSOS Alignment

RSOS supports:

- theoretical frameworks  
- systems science  
- conceptual models  
- AI alignment + ethics frameworks  
- open data and reproducibility  
- cross-disciplinary work  

The LSI framework **meets and exceeds** RSOS guidelines for:

- conceptual novelty  
- mathematical structure  
- reproducibility  
- interdisciplinary significance  

The manuscript is a strong match for the RSOS editorial criteria.

## 5. Submission Readiness

Following this audit:

- The project is ready for LSI v5.2 preparation  
- Receipts RSOS-000 and RSOS-001 form a complete historical chain  
- This RSOS-002 receipt seals the pre-submission state  
- Next step: generate the v5.2 manuscript + cover letter  
- Then: upload to RSOS submission portal  

Everything is aligned for a clean submission.

## 6. Why this receipt exists

To maintain the open-science chain of custody between:

- RSOS-000 — Interface Submission  
- RSOS-001 — Interface Desk Reject  
- RSOS-002 — RSOS Pre-Submission Audit (this document)  
- RSOS-003 — Future RSOS Submission Receipt  

This ensures full transparency for reviewers, future collaborators, and historical record.
