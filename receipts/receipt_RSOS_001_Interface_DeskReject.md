# Receipt RSOS-001 — Interface Desk Reject (Scope decision only)

**Date received:** 17 Nov 2025 (UTC+0)  
**Journal:** Journal of the Royal Society Interface (JRSI)  
**Manuscript ID:** rsif-2025-1170  
**Decision type:** Editorial desk reject  
**Review status:** *Unreviewed — no peer reviewers assigned*  
**Author:** Adam Lee

## 1. Summary of Decision

The submission of *“The Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI v5.1): The Involution Imperative”* was declined at the **editorial screening stage** on the basis of journal scope.

This was an administrative classification decision:

- No scientific critique was issued  
- No comments on content, correctness, or methodology were provided  
- No concerns were raised regarding the mathematical model, invariants, or reproducibility materials  

The rejection occurred prior to peer review.  
The paper was **not scientifically evaluated**.

## 2. Email/Portal Summary (Paraphrased)

> “After consideration, your manuscript has been deemed out of scope for Interface and will not be sent for review.”

This aligns with JRSI’s narrow focus on mechanistic biological physics.

---

## 3. Impact on Scientific Status

Because no reviewers were assigned, this decision has **zero scientific implications**:

- The LSI functional ��(π) remains unchallenged  
- Ω_spirit and the six-invariant structure remain unchallenged  
- The Anti-JALS falsification and C ≈ 0.8 viability score remain unchallenged  
- The Zenodo DOI and all reproducibility receipts remain unaffected  

This event is purely a scope-matching outcome.

## 4. Rationale for RSOS Re-submission

Royal Society Open Science (RSOS) maintains a broader remit:

- Accepts theoretical and conceptual frameworks  
- Welcomes interdisciplinary systems science  
- Encourages submissions with code, reproducibility, and open data  
- Hosts work relevant to AI, ethics, physics, and complex systems  
- Operates with significantly lower desk-reject rates  

Thus RSOS is the **correct Royal Society venue** for this manuscript.

## 5. Next Actions

1. Prepare LSI v5.2 with:
   - minor textual refinements  
   - clearer RSOS-oriented framing  
   - improved invariant consistency  
   - clarified Ω_spirit definition  
2. Re-submit to RSOS with reproducibility links  
3. Log RSOS submission as Receipt RSOS-002 upon completion

## 6. Why this receipt exists

This connects:

- RSOS-000 (Interface Submission)  
- RSOS-001 (Interface Desk Reject)  
- RSOS-002 (RSOS Pre-Submission Audit, this thread)

It keeps the provenance chain intact for open-science reproducibility.
