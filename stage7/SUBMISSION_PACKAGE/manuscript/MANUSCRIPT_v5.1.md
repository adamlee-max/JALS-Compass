## Abstract  
The *Law of Sustainable Intelligence* (LSI) proposes that systems capable of enduring change achieve balance through five invariant dynamics: boundaries, centre, loops, patterns, and history.  
The *JALS Compass* operationalises this principle as a measurable functional \( \mathcal{C}(\pi) \), enabling the evaluation of any system’s viability over time.  

This paper presents the complete theoretical formalisation, empirical falsifiability tests, and audit receipts confirming methodological soundness.  
Dual independent evaluations — Gemini (academic) and Grok (empirical) — validate both the mathematical coherence and philosophical integrity of the framework.  

**Keywords:** sustainable intelligence, systems theory, AI alignment, resilience, balance, governance, dynamic centre.

## 1. Introduction  
- Context: systemic fragility in modern intelligent systems.  
- Objective: to establish a unified measure of sustainable viability.  
- Approach: derive and validate \( \mathcal{C}(\pi) \) across theoretical and applied domains.

## 2. Theoretical Framework  
### 2.1 The Five Invariants  
Define and explain:  
1. **Boundary Symmetry (I₁)**  
2. **Dynamic Centre (I₂)**  
3. **Loop Continuity (I₃)**  
4. **Pattern Sufficiency (I₄)**  
5. **Recurrence (I₅)**  

### 2.2 Functional Definition  
\[
\mathcal{C}(\pi) = f(I_1, I_2, I_3, I_4, I_5, w_i(t,\pi), \kappa_{ij}, \Omega_{\text{spirit}})
\]
- \(w_i(t,\pi)\): dynamic weights.  
- \(\kappa_{ij}\): cross-invariant coupling.  
- \(\Omega_{\text{spirit}}\): coherence term linking quantitative and qualitative balance.

## 3. Empirical Validation  
### 3.1 Null Model (Anti-JALS Collapse)  
Demonstrates falsifiability by inducing systemic imbalance (C < 0.2).  

### 3.2 Recovery & Stability Tests  
Time-series drift analysis confirming C(t) recovery toward +0.8 equilibrium.  

### 3.3 Cross-Domain Verification  
Applications tested across finance, healthcare, education, and AI governance ecosystems.

## 4. Results & Discussion  
- Dimensional consistency maintained.  
- Reproducibility confirmed through Git receipts and Perma.cc records.  
- Gemini and Grok cross-validation establishes internal logical coherence and external falsifiability.  

---

## 5. Implications & Outlook  
- Foundational insight: systems endure when they can hold the centre.  
- Policy implication: transparent, receipt-based auditing supports safe AI evolution.  
- Future work: scaling Compass analytics into open-source “Guardian Layer” frameworks.
