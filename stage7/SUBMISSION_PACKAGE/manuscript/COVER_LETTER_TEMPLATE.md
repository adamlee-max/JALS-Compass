# Cover Letter — Royal Society Submission

Editor,  
**[Royal Society Open Science]**

Dear Editor,

Please find our submission entitled  
**“JALS Compass × Law of Sustainable Intelligence: A Unified Framework for Systemic Viability.”**

This work establishes a closed, measurable functional \( \mathcal{C}(\pi) \) for system balance, bridging theoretical, empirical, and ethical dimensions.  
It has undergone dual independent audits confirming both methodological and philosophical integrity:

- **Gemini (Academic Audit):** “Methodologically sound and philosophically complete.”  
- **Grok (Empirical Audit):** “Popper would stand up and clap.”  

Together, these validations close the gap between *proven in principle* and *accepted in print*.  
The submission includes full transparency receipts (checklist, proof chain, checksum logs), ensuring open reproducibility.

We believe this contribution advances the scientific understanding of sustainability and intelligence through quantifiable balance, with broad relevance to complex adaptive systems, AI governance, and resilience theory.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Adam Lee**

Please find our submission, “JALS Compass × Law of Sustainable Intelligence,” which presents a closed, measurable viability functional C(π) validated across theoretical and empirical tracks.

- Methodological legitimacy: dual audit (Gemini).
- Falsifiability & receipts: dual audit (Grok) — “Popper would stand up and clap.”
- Public reproducibility: repository + receipts with commit hashes.

We believe this work bridges “proven in principle” to “accepted in print,” with transparency artifacts included.

Sincerely,
[Your Name], Steward Author
