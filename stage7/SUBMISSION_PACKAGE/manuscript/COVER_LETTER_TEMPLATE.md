Editor,
[Royal Society Journal Name]

Please find our submission, “JALS Compass × Law of Sustainable Intelligence,” which presents a closed, measurable viability functional C(π) validated across theoretical and empirical tracks.

- Methodological legitimacy: dual audit (Gemini).
- Falsifiability & receipts: dual audit (Grok) — “Popper would stand up and clap.”
- Public reproducibility: repository + receipts with commit hashes.

We believe this work bridges “proven in principle” to “accepted in print,” with transparency artifacts included.

Sincerely,
[Your Name], Steward Author
