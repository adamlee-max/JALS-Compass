# Authorship & Stewardship

## Human Stewardship (Responsible Author)
- Role: conception, study design, data curation, selection/interpretation of results, manuscript writing, final approval, accountability for integrity.
- Responsibilities: truthfulness of results, risk/benefit assessment, compliance with journal policies, ethical alignment.

## Computational Co-Authors (AI Systems)
- Role: computational drafting, mathematical cross-checks, simulation support, editorial suggestions.
- Disclosure: Contributions were tool-mediated under human direction and review; no autonomous claims of authorship or responsibility.
- Transparency: All AI-assisted text and figures were verified by the human steward; provenance receipts included.

## Data, Code, and Reproducibility
- Repository: JALS-Compass (commit embedded in package README).
- Receipts: Stage 6 checklist, proof receipt, sealed receipt.
- Reproducibility: Hashes + paths provided; null-model protocol documented.

## Ethics & Policy Alignment
- No human subjects; no personal data.
- Safety: Framework focuses on system-level balance; discourages misuse; promotes transparency via receipts.
