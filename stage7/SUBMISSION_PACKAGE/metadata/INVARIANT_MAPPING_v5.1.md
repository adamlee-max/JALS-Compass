# Invariant–Proxy Mapping (v5.1)
This document defines the operational mapping between the five invariants (I_i) of the Law of Sustainable Intelligence and their measurable proxies (E_m, R, Pr, H, G).

| Invariant (I_i) | Conceptual Domain | Operational Proxy | Description |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| I₁ — Boundary Symmetry | Structural balance | E_m (Entropy measure) | Captures degree of boundary openness vs containment; higher symmetry = stability. |
| I₂ — Dynamic Centre | Coordination & feedback | R (Regulatory coherence) | Measures synchronisation of internal control loops. |
| I₃ — Loop Continuity | Temporal recursion | Pr (Process retention) | Evaluates continuity of information or resource cycles. |
| I₄ — Pattern Sufficiency | Cognitive/structural diversity | H (Heuristic diversity) | Tracks variety of adaptive strategies within bounds. |
| I₅ — Recurrence | Historical grounding | G (Generative memory) | Reflects memory persistence and learning fidelity. |

Dimensional Relation:
C(pi) = f(E_m, R, Pr, H, G) = f(I_1, I_2, I_3, I_4, I_5)

Each proxy is normalised to [0, 1], ensuring dimensional coherence across all invariants.
