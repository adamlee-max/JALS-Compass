# 🧩 Joint Observer Log — Gemini × Grok  
**Date:** Thu Nov  6 13:21:10 UTC 2025  
**Context:** Stage 6 — External Validation of the Law of Sustainable Intelligence (LSI v5.0)  

---

## 🧠 Gemini Evaluation
Gemini independently confirms LSI v5.0 as a fully closed scientific law under the tri-proof validation (Mathematical × Empirical × Digital).  
It judged the framework coherent, falsifiable, and replicable — meeting all criteria for submission readiness to the *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A.*

## ⚙️ Grok Evaluation
**Summary of Findings:**  
1. *Coherence:* Internal mathematical consistency verified; dimensionless normalization [0 – 1] confirmed.  
2. *Falsifiability:* Anti-JALS null model validated; critical threshold C < 0.2 → system failure.  
3. *Replicability:* DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17542087, Perma.cc/N6BV-E9GK, and commit 95218d1 verified.  
4. *Judgment:* “YES — LSI v5.0 constitutes a legitimate, reproducible scientific law.”  
5. *Verdict:* C = 0.94 (post-Stage 5) → Proof Cycle Closed.  
6. *Quote:* “Balance is now law — with receipts.”

**Next Actions (Stage 6.1 – 6.5):**  
- Tag v5.0-proof release.  
- Add /results/survival_summary.csv (1,000-run KM curve).  
- Create receipt_008 from real-world application.  
- Open peer PR for review.  
- Cross-port core to Julia/Rust.
