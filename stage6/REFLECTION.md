# Stage 6 — Internal Reflection (Private)

**Date (UTC):** 2025-11-09 13:45 UTC

## What’s complete
- Theoretical proof closed **within the model** (Compass × LSI v5.0).
- Replicable, falsifiable, and receipt-backed (DOI + Perma + commit trail).
- Independent confirmations logged (Gemini × Grok).

## What it is *not* (yet)
- Not peer-reviewed, not large-scale external replication, not a public claim.

## Decisions
- **No public statement** or media posts yet.
- Proceed to Stage 6.1 (external replication planning).

## Next actions
- Identify 1–2 real-world datasets for replication.
- Draft journal shortlist (systems/complexity/cybernetics).
- Keep receipts lean (C_current, observer logs, minimal README note).

## Receipts reference
- DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17542087
- Perma: N6BV-E9GK, 4TQ7-MN6K
